# TODOs

This module is intended to make it easier to provide a reasonable configured logger for the application-wide use by all the NestJs loggers.
This intention is already being fulfilled, so I am not sure if there is room for improvement :-)
We are already able to modify the behaviour of this logger as well, as building additional loggers based on our WinstonLogger

Maybe in the future we want to provide additional Loggers for special use cases or maybe we want to make it easier to configure additional Winston transports...
